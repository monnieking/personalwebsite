            <h3>My story</h3>
        </header>
        <p>
            Every new adventure starts with a painful ending. I've always found this to be true - at least in my case.
            It all started with a guy. Actually - two guys, who changed my life.
        </p>
        <p>
            But before that - a little bit about me. My story begins when I moved out of my little <em>barangay</em> in
            the Philippines. Growing up in Manila - I left my family at 18 for a better life in the UK. I worked
            late-nights at my local pubs cleaning beer-washed floors and scrubbing down the women‚Äôs toilets while
            working my way up. I studied and took one internship after the other until one day, I got my first full-time
            role in marketing.
        </p>
        <header>
            <h3>Meeting the guys</h3>
        </header>
        <p>
            That‚Äôs where I met my co-worker Andrea. He was a front-end developer at the EdTech startup I work for. The
            guy is a talented 21-year-old, and the sole developer in our startup. We became good friends and on a whim,
            decided that we got along so well that we had to become flatmates. The truth is, I always admired what he
            did at work. He had the ability to build anything he wanted to, just because he can. When he‚Äôd push for new
            updates, I was always amazed how he (quickly) built one new feature after the other.
        </p>
        <p>
            I was also dating a guy named Joe, who was doing a web developer bootcamp. Again, there I was, prying Joe
            with questions - why he chose web development, if he wants to focus on the front-end or back-end, how he got
            started, and so on. He introduced me to terminologies like ‚ÄòAPIs‚Äô - and he‚Äôd walk me through his code
            whenever he built new projects - so that he fully understood what was going on. It‚Äôs nice to see both sides
            of being a successful web developer (Andrea) and what it takes to get there (Joe). More and more - I felt
            that I was being pulled into the software engineering space.
        </p>
        <header>
            <h3>Exploring front-end development</h3>
        </header>
        </p>
        It's because of both of them that I felt inspired to start coding. I remember knocking on Andrea's door on
        Saturday afternoons and asked if he could help me build my personal blog. It transported me back to my teen
        years, when I was editing HTML and CSS to customize Wordpress themes. Then those markup tutorials became
        Javascript - and I was enjoying the process!
        </p>
        <p>
            A few months later, an opportunity came up at work to find two front-end engineers. I was interested to
            learn more, so I volunteered to handle the recruitment process. I got to look at different projects and see
            what a front-end engineer actually does. I felt inspired, and decided I wanted to ‚Äòformally‚Äô begin my coding
            journey. I started a Ruby course on codeacademy in February.
        </p>
        <p>
            It was all great until last month - when I was let go from my job. I gave the role everything I had, which
            is why it was so painful. It‚Äôs a tough time with COVID - especially for junior staff. It was even more
            painful that I was let go the week I had a breast cancer scare. I felt like my world was coming to an end.
            All that I worked for - the five years I've barely seen my family - couldn't come down to this. Marketing
            has been a great ride. But - I felt something was missing. I was looking for a path where I can apply both
            my creative side and logical thinking - and I felt so lost on what to do.
        </p>
        <header>
            <h3>A moment of clarity</h3>
        </header>
        <p>
            It was at this point where I thought about making a career change to front-end development. I saw ReactJS
            was in-demand in London - so I made the shift from Ruby. My cousin (a self-taught software engineer),
            recommended that I start a Udemy course on Javascript. So - that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm doing. Whatever I learn, I
            create small projects for each section I completed. There's so much creativity I didn't realize coding had!
            Creativity to others might be something like art or design. Coding taught me that it's more than that - it's
            creatively coming up with different solutions as well. With my job ending, I realized that I‚Äôm not lost -
            I‚Äôm exactly where I‚Äôm supposed to be. Things had to end to get a moment of clarity - and I got mine with
            code.
        </p>

            <h3>Shoutout to codebar + Makers</h3>
        </header>
        <p>
            Codebar has helped me immensely in this process. Software engineers always tell me that community is the
            most important thing when learning to code. That being said, codebar has been incredibly supportive with
            their weekly workshops and panel discussions. I‚Äôm enjoying code so much, and when I want to take it further
            - codebar has helped me get there. Whether I'm stuck in a concept or just wanting to explore opportunities -
            so grateful to all your coaches for dedicating their time!
        </p>
        <p>
            I've also spoken to Maker's graduates, who speak highly of the program. I've done a LinkedIn stalk of what
            front-end engineers did after the Makers bootcamp and compared it with existing ones on a Google Sheet - and
            Makers graduates stand out by miles. Not to mention, the balance between theory and a project-based learning
            curriculum is what I'm after. After speaking to self-taught engineers and those from bootcamps, there are
            some skills being self-taught can‚Äôt offer me - like pair programming, learning to write clean code and code
            reviews. It would also be beneficial to be around a supportive community - the waycodebar has been to me!
        </p>
        <header>
            <h3>Reaching the end</h3>
        </header>
        <p>
            In short - I‚Äôd love to be considered for the scholarship. I know it's early days, but in the last month,
            I've put my heart into my coding journey - just hope you can see the passion come through. If nothing else,
            I just want to say that I appreciate all the work the codebar has done for me. Hope you're good!
